# Abstract
This project focuses on the task of news summarization. Currently,
there is no end to the tidal wave of news articles on the internet. Every
single insignificant event seems to spawn hundreds of additional news arti-cles. 
For the average person, it is too much stimulus. It is a well-researched
idea that too much stimulus causes stress. Dogs when experiencing too
much change start barking uncontrollably and lose control of their bladder. 
Similarly, humans when they are exposed to unnatural amounts of
stimuli exhibit certain destructive behaviours. 

It is best then, that thisstimuli is reduced and simplified as much as possible. 
This was the needout of which this project was born. Given any topic, the 
project willoutput summaries of news articles relating to that topic. 
If we give theprogram an input of ”Trump”, it will search the web for articles 
relating to Trump, and provide summaries for the articles that it finds in that
web-search. Using this, an average person can get a decent understanding
of what is going on in the world without being exposed to too much stimulus. 
Our program is built on and runs on Python. It uses the TextRank algorithm
as its base. Using this TextRank algorithm, we can easily rank
out and pick the most relevant sentences from a text.
